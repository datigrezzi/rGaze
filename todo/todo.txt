todo:

ivt:
1. change processed file export name to use input data name + '_processed.csv'
2. add parameter to interpolate missing samples up to n samples and delete the rest to control for whatever creates NAs in the data, like KeyPresses
3. test with higher sampling rates (TX300)
4. add parameter to join close fixations/saccades

fixations:
1. change processed file export name to use input data name + '_fixations.csv'
2. add variable to get trials/media from which to calculate time 0 (for growth curves)

saccades:
1. change processed file export name to use input data name + '_saccades.csv'
2. add variable to get trials/media from which to calculate time 0 (for srts)
