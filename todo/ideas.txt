Tool to draw AOIs and export coordinates file (python?)
-----------------------------------------
potential problems:
â€¢ ivt with multiple participants can theoretically create problems of extended saccade over different participants. add single or multiple participants parameter to avoid the problem

-----------------------------------------
ideas for heatmaps:
# script to ask for picture of stimulus (adjust dimensions?) and plot given x,y coordinates over the picture
# either as heatmap (with colormap option) or as trail with variable diameter (taking into account fixation length)

for image import and analysis:
pixmap package at: 
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2003-May/033818.html

but before we'll need to convert the images, maybe using:
imagemahick at:
http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php?ImageMagick=ethh8ajk24hjnj7fpjir9pj405#macosx

as for the ordinal label for the scatter points:
after points and scatter or whatever, we can use:
text(x,y,c(),pos=)
pos:1=bottom, 2=left,3=top,4=right,and/or overlay

new ideas:
multicore :)
